The Minor in Japanese emphasizes language study while also recognizing the importance of learning about Japan through work in fields such as literature, history, anthropology, and religion. This program will be of particular interest to students interested in careers in education, business, government, or other professions where Japanese language proficiency is important. The minor requires completion of 18 credits.  Required courses include Japanese Intermediate II, Japanese Advanced I and II, and three specified content courses.  Students who place out of one or more Japanese-language courses must replace those requirements with electives approved by the Minor in Japanese faculty advisor.

The minor in Japanese emphasizes language study while recognizing the importance of learning about Japan through literature, history, anthropology and religion. This program will be of particular interest to students who seek careers in education, business, government or other professions where Japanese language proficiency is important. The minor requires completion of 18 credits.  Required courses include [Intermediate Japanese II](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=JPNS+2002), [Advanced Japanese I](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=JPNS+3001), [Advanced Japanese II](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=JPNS+3002) and three specified content courses. Students who place out of one or more Japanese language courses must replace those requirements with electives approved by the minor in Japanese faculty advisor.
